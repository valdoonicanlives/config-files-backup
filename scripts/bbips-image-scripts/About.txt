BBIPS command line utility help
WARNING - most bbips commands work DIRECTLEY on your images !!! 
It is recommended that you work on jpg COPIES ONLY to prevent loss of originals.
bbcopy | Create a directory and COPY all images into it. example:
bbcopy ANYNAMEHERE 

copies all the .jpg's into a new dir ANYNAMEHERE 

then cd into the ANYNAMEHERE dir and run any of the commands you want on these images....as they are copies of the main ones
You can ALSO script these together into a bashscript
eg, see example script at the bottom.
Note, I just usually create a hidden directory for the bbips scripts. (~/.bbips) and then create a set of alias's in my .bashrc file. I included them below in case someone would like to cut-n-paste vs type alot. 
alias bbapcom='bash ~/.bbips/bbapcom'
alias bbatxt='bash ~/.bbips/bbatxt'
alias bbborder='bash ~/.bbips/bbborder'
alias bbcolorize='bash ~/.bbips/bbcolorize'
alias bbcopy='bash ~/.bbips/bbcopy'

=========================================
example script:

#!/bin/bash
# File: mybbscript

#### First lets make copies of the images and put them into a new directory called COPYS
bbcopy COPYS
#### Next, lets now move into the COPYS directory
cd COPYS
#### Now we are going to resize all the images in the copies directory to 800x800 max size
bbresize 800 800
#### Now we are putting a 2 pixel black border on every image
bbborder black 2
#### Now we are converting all images to black and white
bbgrayscale
#### Now we are putting text on every image
bbatxt "Produced with bbips command line utilites"
#### Now we are done  :)
exit 0
