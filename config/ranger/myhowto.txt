----------------
After startup, ranger creates a directory ~/.config/ranger/. You can copy the default configuration files to this directory with the following command:

ranger --copy-config=all

They can then be customized. Some basic knowledge of python is useful.

    rc.conf controls startup commands and key bindings
    commands.py controls the commands which are launched with the ":" key
    rifle.conf controls the applications used when a given type of file is launched. 

You can launch files with "l" (ell) or "<Enter>". For rc.conf, you need only include changes from the default file, since both are loaded. For commands.py, if you do not include the whole file, put this line at the top:

from ranger.api.commands import *

--------------
version 1.6 or later
 Added feature to draw images inside the console using w3mimgdisplay (you need
  to add "set preview_images true" in rc.conf
------------
line 224 says
map <DELETE>   console delete is default have changed it to below DK
map <DELETE>   shell trash-put %s
you can install trash-cli and map it to the Delete key instead so taht files go to the trash have done DK
-------------
The following example shows how to use "DD" to move selected files to a directory ~/.Trash/. Put this code in ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf

# move to trash
map DD shell mv -t /home/myname/.config/ranger/Trash %s
----------
 Opening files with a given application

Modify ~/.config/ranger/rifle.conf. Since the beginning lines are executed first, you should put your modifications at the beginning of the file. For example, the following entry will open a tex file with kile.

ext tex = kile "$@"
------------
 External Drives

External drives can be automatically mounted with a udev rule or with the help of an automounting Udev wrapper. Drives mounted under /media can be easily accessed by pressing gm (go, media).
