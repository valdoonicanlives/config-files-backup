was easy to build
make
sudo make install
it copied the exe to
/usr/local/bin

If no configuration file is specified via the _-c_ option, the following is used: *$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sxhkd/sxhkdrc*.

-------------
in the examples folder there is this entry to put in xinitrc
[ -e "$SXHKD_FIFO" ] && rm "$SXHKD_FIFO"
mkfifo "$SXHKD_FIFO"
sxhkd -s "$SXHKD_FIFO" &

not sure what its for yet but think you only need it if you want it to display a notify messege when keys are pressed,
---------------
an example file
to run it - tried it and it worked - aprt from launching claws-mail - think the command it wrong but geany worked
sxhkd -c ~/.config/sxhkd/myconfig
myconfig would be the name ofthe file holding your config like the example below

super + o ; {e,w,m}
    {geany,iceweasel,claws-mail}
    
----------------------
    What do you call the 'alt gr' modifier in sxhkd?

Probably mode_switch.   yes that works
