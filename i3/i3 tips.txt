As explained in the i3 documentation, to focus on a window of class, say, "Emacs", it is enough to write:

bindsym $mod+x [class="Emacs"] focus

However, I'd like to focus on a Emacs window unless the Emacs window has a certain title, say, "emacs_scratchpad". I'm not sure how to implement the unless bit. Does anyone know?

bindsym $mod+x [class="Emacs" title="^(?!emacs_scratchpad)"] focus
-----------------------------------


# cycle through bstacked windows (dwm style)
bindsym $mod+Tab focus down
#to toggle between layout styles instead of W-e or W-w you can use
bindsym $mod+space layout toggle all

# custom variables for workspaces
set $ws1 1:term
set $ws2 2:media
set $ws3 3:inet
set $ws4 4:dev
set $ws5 5:docs
set $ws6 6:irc/im
set $ws7 7:sys
set $ws8 8:vbox
set $ws9 9:min
would then need to change things like
# switch to workspace 
bindsym $mod+1 workspace $ws1
bindsym $mod+2 workspace $ws2
bindsym $mod+3 workspace $ws3
bindsym $mod+4 workspace $ws4
bindsym $mod+5 workspace $ws5
bindsym $mod+6 workspace $ws6
bindsym $mod+7 workspace $ws7
bindsym $mod+8 workspace $ws8
bindsym $mod+9 workspace $ws9
